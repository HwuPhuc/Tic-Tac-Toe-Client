#Tic-Tac-Toe Client
Since the code is like a mess, I need to write this: This is actually an application I created as a project at the end of one of the courses at school, I assigned the IP of the server point to my friends' device, which acted as a server in the demo, that's why I delete the IP part for safety purposes, if you want the code to run properly, you need to go to ClientSocket.java file and change the value of IPServer variable to the IP of the device that run the server code (which I coded to create at 127.0.0.1, in other words, the computer run the server code)

A tic-tac-toe game created by using Java language for learning purpose.

The aim is to understand how to make an online game where players can connect to each other through Internet and play together.

Using only a text file (.txt) to store player informations (account, password, username, statistics) since the project is focusing on create a connection between 2 users (If I have time I will use another better method to store beccause this is lame)

Make sure to run the main file on the CaroServer folder (project) first, so that the CaroClient folder (project) can run properly.

I study from this project below to make mine (Need to add this because this guy's project help me learn a lot in this topic)
